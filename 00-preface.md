# Preface

Martin claims that **the rules of software architecture are the same**
regardless of the system and have been (so far) invariant in time.

- This includes single-threaded apps, multi-threaded apps, apps with few
  heavy-weight processes, apps with many light-weight processes,
  multiprocessor apps, database apps, mathematical apps, etc.
- This also includes different programming languages.
- He justifies this claim in the fact that the basic constructs of
  programming languages have remained unchanged since the 1960s.
