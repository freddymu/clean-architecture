# Part IV - Component Principles

The [SOLID design principles in part III](part-3-design-principles.md)
showed us how to arrange code into classes / modules and how to
interconnect those classes.

Part IV will go one level up to show us what **components** are, how to
compose them and how they should interact in a system.


## Chapter 12 - What Components Are

Components are units of deployment. Jar files in Java, Gems in Ruby,
DLLs in .Net.

Good component design retains **independence of deployability and
independence of developability.**
