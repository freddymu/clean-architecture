This is a detailed summary of the Clean Architecture book. This is a
work in progress. However, anything added to the table of content below
has been finalized.

- [Preface](00-preface.md)
- [Part I - Introduction](part-1-introduction.md)
- [Part II - Starting with the Bricks: Programming Paradigms](part-2-starting-with-the-bricks-programming-paradigms.md)
- [Part III - Design Principles](part-3-design-principles.md)
- [Part IV - Component Principles](part-4-component-principles.md)
- Part V - Architecture
  - This is the main part of the book. I've divided it into two subparts
    to assist reading.
    - [Subpart 1](part-5-1-architecture.md)
    - [Subpart 2](part-5-2-architecture.md)
